## Introduction
This repo is a Waqf Tokenization and Charity web3 project for Haqq hackathon.
The reason we build this project mainly:
  - Low transaction of shodaqoh especially for waqf in Indonesia eventhough there are lots of Muslims in Indonesia
  - Most waqf assets are unproductive, the main 2 assets for land assets are Musholla and Masjid eventhough there are a lot of things that can be build on waqf assets, such as: Agriculture, Aquatics and so on which could contribute to the economy
  - Datas for land waqf assets are mostly uncertified and the real total number of waqf assets are not known because it is rarely updated

By making this project, we hope that it could help in Indonesia Emas 2045

## Solutions
Why must I interact with this web3 project?
- Web3 is decentralized which means it is safer than ever. We want to keep it decentralized as much as possible.
- It will be similar to web2 but with web3 wallets and not through banks!
  
- For charity transaction will be similar with other web2 projects, BUT! we introduce the DAO governance, in which the charity proposal must be voted by the Lagoon Token Owners. So before you can donate, the Lagoon Token Owners will vote to support or oppose the proposal for 7 days. If majority is voting support, then the charity can receive donations.
- When you donate, you will get incentives in a form of token and Nft!
- The token can be used to vote as well, so welcome to the family!
  
- Why must waqf be tokenized? To prevent from third-party claiming the asset to be theirs.
- Not every waqf asset can be tokenized. They must be certified and the nazir must be legit through web3 identification. It will take a 7 days process for the voters to vote as well and if majority voted support then CONGRATULATIONS! Your asset can be tokenized.
- After your asset is tokenized, you can share your token with other people similar to stocks. If you get profit, do not forget to give some to your investors as well
  
- In the future, we would like to partner with: Web3 Identifications, Security Detectives and Web3 Certification to provide a more secure and trusted platform
